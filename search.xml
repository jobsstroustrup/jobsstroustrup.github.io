By this way, experimental and clinical tests can distinguish effective and safe drugs from bad drugs, which may even bring severe side effects to patients. And FDA, as well as “generic drugs”, is aimed at setting such basic rules for drugs. It is clear that drugs safety depends on the effectiveness of these rules and process of executing. However, the system for testing drugs and whether the drugs meet the requirements of FDA, are based on manufacturer’s own conscience. To be specific, the administrater won’t see the results of experiments or tests themselves but rather see reports on those experiments. The lack of overseeing the experiments and checking the validity of data is making room for fake data. If the drugs can pass the test, then everything is okay. But if the drugs fail the test, manufacturer may fake their data instead of purifying their drugs to pass the test, and make their fortune by selling potentially uneffective to the world.<br>This news also reminds me of a movie about an Indian drugs manufacturer forged HIV drugs and sold these drugs to Indians or Chinese. However, in that movie, the forged drugs were as effective as real ones. Because the real drugs were protected by intelligence laws and were sold in high prices, most people could only buy forged drugs in black markets. At last, the manufacturer was arrested for violating the intelligence law, but the government decided to lend a helping hand to people by offering subsidies.<br>To ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs, there are mainly two approaches. The first one is to make sure admistraters on drugs can actually see the process of making drugs and results of tests on drugs. The second one is to let patients know more information about drugs they use. Some basic facts like how the drugs are produced, where they are produced and results of tests should be shown to buyers and patients.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

And with development of parades for Goerge Floyd, racial problem comes on the table again. Personally speaking, I don’t think impressions based on one’s skin color, one’s family, one’s status, one’s appearance  are not justified at all. Those things can serve as indicators of people to a certain degree. Of course, indicators mentioned above, to be more specific, all kinds of indicators, are not 100% precise. But from the view of possibility, behaving differently to different people based on their “indicators” is reasonable and rational, which can bring about greatest amount of averaged benefits(just like gaining greatest expectations in statistic problems in math). But in most cases, people won’t contact others only once, and they may encounter others repeatedly. Hence, the most idealized circumstance is that a person need to adjust his/her manners to others based on their following interactions afterwards. So when they first meet, one might hurt others’ feelings only based on, like, others’ race and skin color. But afterwards, with more communication, one probably realize that others are not the kind of people he/she thinks before.  This is the first adjustment one should be aware of.<br>The second rectification is that one’s perception of others’ “indicators” should be “updated” to the “latest version”. It is common nowadays that some people still use outdated “version” of “indicators”, say, last 20 years’ version or even last century’s. This may be due to some people’s lack of updated information or not choosing to walk out of their thinking pattern and circle. If a person only get access to one kind of information, the information will reinforce itself and it’s hard for him/her to get out. To get rid of it, one need to know about more information from more sources and try to think a bit differently.<br>To be honest, these two adjustments are not easy for everyone. This is a complicated world. There are complicated circumstances. But to make it forward, I still think to help people get better education(not just learn to work out some math problems or to recite some articles or to know some basic knowledge in each subject) and to advocate more people to achieve these two adjustments mentioned above are essential.  </p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

There are still huge conflicts about whether impacts of colonies are overall advantageous or disadvantageous. The professor, as well as I, thinks that we cannot embellish colonies as something benevolent or nice. The major parts of colonies are still dark and ruthless. In my opinion, cologial behavior is driven by profits and therefore, what colonizers did was not for residents in colonies but for their own benefits. When benefits of colonizers and residents came into conflicts, in most times, residents had nothing to do but surrender. It is undeniable that some settlers in colonies did something nice and kind, like helping sick local people etc, but colonization is evil and bloody in general.<br>All things happen for “history”. Colonization still has huge impacts on south-east Asia nowadays, like how local people represent themselves, what they think about their past and history, and how they interact with people from countries which colonized them in the past.<br>Jump out of box and have independent thinking. This is important for not only professors, but also each individual in society. Independent thinking helps to distinguish reasonable views between just rumors and to form one’s own history views and world views. Of course, to achieve this needs some reading and thinking. It doesn’t require people to become experts in related fields. Just be cautious about everyone’s ideas, even he/she is the most informative guy and compare different ideas about same issues. MOre acceptance on new ideas (not necessarily the correct ideas) and critical thinking help the society to get rid of stereotypes and move forward in history.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

Typically, with similar interests, people can get together; with conflicting values, people will split apart. Most people always stay in their circle, holding their original beliefs and reinforcing their world views. But to achieve better relationships with more people, to get out of your comfort zone, you have to learn to negotiate and find common grounds with others. This is not easy for most times. It's easier to get rage and disagree with others than to calm down and have a thorough thinking about why others would think like that, why I would think like this and whether there are possibilities to live together without forced changes on either's beliefs. To find common grounds, the first is to show extravagent grace to others. "Extravagent" means that even if sometimes others' behavior offends us, we still need to keep calm and try to communicate. In this more and more divided world, people are easy to get into what is called AGONISM. If people love someone, they agree to all he/she does or believes. If people disagree with someone, they hate or fear him/her. Only based on common grounds, can people calmly discuss with others and try to understand. And only with grace rather than explosion with anger, can people try to find common grounds. Lastly, we still need to be cautious about the degree of tolerance and grace. Single or several unconcious offenses can be tolerated, but intentional, frequent and illegal offenses need to be handled through laws.<table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

The speeker, with genetic mutations on immune system, has lived with cancers, to be specific, not just a single cancer, since her childhood. The greatest uncertainty, I mean, to all people, is when your life will come to cease. You don’t know whether what you do everyday will make a difference in the future because you may just have to stop sometimes. You can stay where you are and do nothing; or do what you want to do the most right here and right now. You are left with only these two choices. Think more about it, and you’ll find, the best choice is to stop the uncertainty interfering your own life and just be yourself, do what you want, become whom you want to be and strive for it. Whether you come to your goal fast or not does not matter, and what matters is that you want your each day meaningful and progress towards your goal.<br>Besides, there are also great distinctions between American and Chinese doctors’ methods, attitudes towards patients, especially patients with cancers. Less respect on patients’ desires and too much efforts on therapy itself sometimes make Chinese doctors utilitarian and cruel. There must be some reasons underlying the comparatively tense relationship between doctors and patients. To correct highly utilitarian atmosphere in medical fields, it is a long way to go.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>
