        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now the world is recovering from COVID-19 pandemic, but memories of sorrow won’t dissipate easily from people’s minds. It is the faults from many procedures to handle this pandemic that caused more innocent people to die, for example, the weakness of global coorperation WHO, non-transparency in many countries, policy mistakes from some leaders and so on. In this post, situations in China will be mainly discussed.</p><p>Of course, faults from governments, medical areas and academia were combined together. Governments in China, to a certain degree, cccccccounccccaeled the information, not only for the outside world, but also their own people. Most people didn’t know what was going on in January, 2020. Only governers on the first line, very senior governors, doctors, nurses and officially-dispatched experts knew more about the pandemic. The public were as optimistic as usual. THe medical area and academia weren’t independent from politics, meaning that they couldn’t give out data about virus without permissions, otherwise penalties would fall on traitors. For eample, one professor Dr. Zhang’s laboratory had been shut down for his leak on the genetic sequence of coronavirus. </p><p>Besides, the extent of global coorperation nowadays is not enough to handle world-wide pandemic. WHO needed to “suck up” member countries to coax them to coorperate. So in interviews, WHO officials would always keep at the same line as foreign affairs of member countries. For instance, WHO kept the same tone as China on whether there were human-to-human transmission in January 2020, with the same vagueness. This is true not only for China but also other member countries. On global pandemic issues in history, such world organizations could not work together in much transpirancy. Because of independency of each membership, WHO or UN right now is not powerful enough to fix hard problems.</p><p>At last, as the consequence of China’s treats on coronavirus, with much vagueness and concealing. The confirmed cases were much under-estimated because they needed to get approval from leaders in hospitals and governments. Aside from data about cases, the research on virus is also restricted by governments, like who could do the research, what could be shown to the outside or the public.</p><p>Apparently, the whole world needs to be more transparent and responsible to better handle on the next big global pandemic, which is sure to happen, just a matter of time. But it’s such a pity that this world is getting towards the opposite now.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

      <title>Reflection on Conspiracy Theory</title>
      <link href="/2021/03/05/reflection-on-conspiracy-theory/"/>
      <url>/2021/03/05/reflection-on-conspiracy-theory/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People tend to deeply believe in conspiracy theory and love to spread it. I have always been wondering why conspiracy theory has such a great power. And the fact that some famous conspiracy-spread celebrities exploit these notorious theory to make a fortune and show big influence on the public makes me feel more upset. I sometimes doubt their motivation on producing these conspiracy theories, for like just make a living or want to be famous, and of course, this route to being famous relys more on live-performance and emotional expressions, not as high-demanding as starting a company or working hard to earn a fortune. I think a Chinese proverb can accurately describe this phenomenon, which, translated into English is that they are either too foolish or too evil, only these two possibilities.</p><p>I conclude several points about why conspiracy theory can spread so fast and extensively. First, sensational news can spread more quickly and get more clicks than objective news. People are likely to spread some horrible and shocking news as so to warn others to get away from such dangers or get together to tackle dangers, like an intuition inside human being’s DNA. However, most news, especially only-present-facts news, normal people won’t get a big reaction so these news cannot be spread fast and far. And people who firstly produce these conspiracy theories could be regared as whistlers and savers. </p><p>Second, conspiracy theories is much easier than truth, or true news. Take global warming as an example. Most conspiracy still have deductions, arguments and conclusions. Conspiracy theorists declare that “because Texas is geting colder and colder, so global warming is just a lie”. It only contain one sentence and it’s easy to get the point for the public. But true news need to say that “global warming is about climate rather than weather. And it would happen in the next few decades or even at the end of 21st century, not now. And global warming is more about the whole Earth, instead of some specific areas, so somewhere cooling and warming on the whole can co-exist”. It takes 3-4 sentences to explain the fact, and people still need to look up more information to comprehend.</p><p>We need to admit that the education level is very imbalanced not only in a country but also globally, and that most people right now haven’t get the chance to learn or self-learn the ability to think comprehensively, be open to other opinions, compare information from different sources, give up their original opinions if there’s something better and if they are convinced, and get their independent thinking system. So this problem on conspiracy theory still have a long way to go. </p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

      <title>Reflection on Control of Opioid Drugs</title>
      <link href="/2021/01/15/reflection-on-control-of-drugs/"/>
      <url>/2021/01/15/reflection-on-control-of-drugs/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Human’s war on drugs, especially opioid drugs never stop. Most countries face the overt or covert war on drugs and many announce that obtaining excess opioid drugs, or a step further, heroin, is illegal.<br>In China, actually only a few people are prescribed with opioid drugs when they are facing extreme pains. And because of strict regulations on drugs, ordinary people have no access to the drugs, though there are some news reports that movie stars or sports stars uses drugs to get high. When people are caught using or holding or selling drugs, they will be sentenced to a long time in jail and huge amount of fines or even to death. This is the reason why criminal gangs of drugs is not a severe problem in China. So people having drugs are mostly from the dark side of society, like gang members, or from the upper level, like celebrities.<br>In United States, the circumstance is well described by the phrase “the opioid epidemic”. Due to excess prescriptions on opioid drugs, people gradually get addicted to opioid, some even seeking for heroin because it’s cheaper and more powerful. People charged by using or holding small amount of heroin will face tens of months in jail, a short time compared to that in China. And it’s really hard to keep clean for a long time, most heroin addicts collape after several months and then are put into jail again. This loop will never end. Now different states have divised different ways to handle the problem, to find a balance between putting addicts into jail and educating them to keep clean. According to statistics, most addicts are white people and middle-class people. They have money to buy drugs. This circumstance is quite different from China and the Philippines mentioned below. In my opinion, we should on one hand popularize the education on drugs, especially the outcomes of using drugs, like ruining the whole family, and on the other hand, keep strict rules and strong punishments for those who frequently use drugs. Because people using drugs for many times are nearly impossible to get out and they may influence younger generations when they deal with others on drugs in streets. For example, teenagers may imitate their behavior. Or even these addicts try to sell drugs to teenagers and schools will be contaminated by drugs. So keeping tight on those people is good for making a good social environment for younger generations and this is the basis of our hope that drug problems will be solved in the next few generations.  Also we still don’t want to just abandon those addicts. There are some special clinics selling some not that powerful and harmful drugs to addicts to help them still live a normal life.<br>My last country in this post is the Philippines. The president anounced a whole-country war on drugs in 2016, urging members of the public to kill criminals and drug addicts. In this country, most addicts are from poor communities. And because of the great power of criminal gangs there, drugs are cycled in these poor communities. In the president’s own words, “the war is towards criminal groups and the poor”. However, when police power is extensively used, there are always situations where police don’t respect the suspects’ human rights. And sometimes, police might kill some suspects who should not be sentenced to death. The war is still on, and I need to admit that it is really hard to balance punishing and educating drug users.<br>At last, I think the United Nations should obtain more power to handle transnational criminal problems. This is the greatest source of drugs. Demands and supplies will influence each other. Besides educating and punishing criminals to lower the demands, doing more jobs on the supplies will help a lot.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

      <title>Dance with Uncertainty</title>
      <link href="/2020/12/31/dance-with-uncertainty/"/>
      <url>/2020/12/31/dance-with-uncertainty/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my last post in 2020, one really magic year for all of us. If someone asks me about my greatest gains this year, I would definitely answer with “dance with uncertainty”. This year is filled with uncertainties. And at first, I was really mad at that, mad at most things around me. I witnessed how this covid 19 destroyed each one’s plans and how most countries suffered from this disaster. All the failures during the process again evoked my strong willingness to make this world better and to solve some already shown problems. All these things, these unprecedented things really ruined my plans as well as my moods. But later I just found out that only adaptability is the solution. And since this covid 19, I have paid more attention to uncertainty in everyday life. It lies everywhere actually. Like you are not sure about whether a stock will rise or fall. Or who would be the next president. Although you can try your best to find out which is most likely to come out. However, each choice you make, each bet you have, just involves uncertainty. From a scienticfic point of view, this is due to “the error bar”. Such errors, or uncertainty, may come from biases of the way you are thinking like systematic errors or just random things which cannot be controled and predicted. In a word, such uncertainty can either rise from your mistakes in making plans or just randomly distributed accidents. In reality, when someone predicts that Trump has 51% of possibility to win, he/she omit the uncertainty value. Maybe he/she should go this way, “Trump has 49% to win and the error bar might be 5%”. He/she neglects the uncertainty by accident or just overlook it on purpose to achieve his/her goals.<br>Right now, when I’m going to make plans, choices, or bets, I would tell myself there must be uncertainties. I cannot make perfect plans. I cannot know everything in advance. Therefore, when some unexpected things show up, I won’t be that crazy. Besides, I make myself consider that if something not in my plan happens, what I am gonna do. Although I couldn’t come up with all the plans B for every accident, these plans B still help a lot when accidents really appear. At last, if some huge accidents which are also hard to predict come out, like covid 19, the ultimate solution is just to adapt it, roll with it. And have upbeat moods to make changes happen.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

      <url>/2020/12/26/recommended-ted-on-12262020/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Today’s-Topic-is-about-Human-Challenge-Trial"><a href="#Today’s-Topic-is-about-Human-Challenge-Trial" class="headerlink" title="Today’s Topic is about Human Challenge Trial"></a>Today’s Topic is about Human Challenge Trial</h2><p>In every minute, there will be hundrends of people getting infected by covid19. It’s a race with time to develop effective vaccines. But whether these vaccines can help depends on results of tests, especially the traditional phase three vaccine trials. However, phase three trials usually take months or even years to get enough data because during trials people who get vaccines still live normal life and researchers need to wait to see how many people get infected ultimately. And until enough people get sick, could researchers know about the effcts of vaccines without data bias. So this process would require lots of volunteers and it’s really time-consuming.<br>To handle problems mentioned above, there’s actually another way to test effects of vaccines, namely human challenge trials. During this process, volunteers will be deliberately exposed to virus after getting vaccines. So researchers don’t need to wait for a long time to see trial results or lots of volunteers. So it’s true that this involves risks. Usually, human challenge trials only accept young and healthy volunteers. And from data we already have, people in ages of 20 to 29 only face fewer than 1 percent of possibility to be taken to hospital after getting infected. The death rate in this age group is around 5 thousandths of one percent. So at least for covid19, this human challenge trial won’t be too risky. Another benefit of human challenge trials is that these trials enable researchers to get data about early stages of infection and immune systems because they can control and know when people are exposed to virus. Such precious data is especially helpful for studying the ways of covid19’s transmission. Such data can hardly be obtained by traditional trials because one special aspects of covid19 is that in early stages, many people will only be affected but won’t show any symptoms.<br>Now, over 39,000 people from across the world have volunteered to participate in potential covid19 challenge trials through a nonprofit association 1Day Sooner. WHO has already cited this group as an example needed to run a challenge trial. Back in mid-October, UK announced their intention to conduct a challenge trial at the beginning of 2021. Without doubt, results of challenge trials would shed some light on the mechanisms of covid19 and help to stop it.</p><p>test: coding highlight</p><pre><code>import osprint(os.path)</code></pre><pre class="line-numbers language-python"><code class="language-python"><span class="token keyword">import</span> os<span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>os<span class="token punctuation">.</span>path<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><pre class="line-numbers language-C++"><code class="language-C++">lalala;cout<<p;<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

      <title>Prediction on 2021 Real Estates in China</title>
      <link href="/2020/12/20/prediction-on-2021-real-estates-in-china/"/>
      <url>/2020/12/20/prediction-on-2021-real-estates-in-china/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The price of real estates in Shenzhen has gone through not yet significant change, with percentage of $\frac{2000}{55000}$. But with the process of recovery of economy, such an increasing trend can show the coming of next upsurge of real estates. This year, the government has printed more money than that in 2008 to stimulate economy. And just as before, large amount of these money will go into real estates and other critical industries. The booming of investment and development of these fields can undoutedly make other fields progress and shed the recession as well, which is good for overall recovery and look good in the world. It will also make the increasing rate of GDP appear nice. And therefore, in spite of imbalance of supply and demand, which would make the price lower, the potential of rising price is much greater than that of decreasing price.<br>The price may go up for the following reasons:</p><ol><li><p>the country needs real estates and relevant investments to stimulate the economy to lead the recovery of economy in the world.</p></li><li><p>investors now have huge amount of money and they need to find somewhere to invest(the current situation is that more money face less goods), and comparatively, real estates are more stable than other fields. Besides, the potential in some newly prosperous cities has not been fully exploited. That is to say, the price’s still not reaching the upper limit. For example, in Xi’an or Chengdu, now the average price is about 16,000. But that price in already developed cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen is about 60,000 or even more. So when investors from these cities come over to Xi’an or Chengdu, they will stimulate the price. In some more developed districts in Xi’an, with better infrastructure, the price could even go up from 20,000 right now to 40,000 or even 50,000 I guess. And such a price is not a big deal to these investors. Some people may blame these real estates for astronomical price, but that does not totally make sense because there must be real estates in some districts which appeal to elites rather than ordinary people. And there are already many people in Xi’an or Chengdu with enough income to buy these houses.</p></li><li><p>now, after nearly 8 years’s political struggle, leaders kind of already have overall advantages in the whole country. Their group have the power and control in the central committee and the state council and most of areas in provinces. But the group don’t have power in every aspect, especially in province level. So letting provincial states make profits in real estates could also strenthen their team’s power. Enhancement in economy power can improve their political power. It is critical especially before the coming of election 2023.</p></li><li><p>In some newly prosperous cities, there are still room for price to go up.</p></li></ol><p>Whether the price will go up or down depends on the comparison between strengths of going-up factors and going-down factors. Going-down factors mainly come from supply glut and the governments’ determination to handle this problem. However, compared to obtaining steady and stable political positions by strengthening both economy and political power, handling the real estates problem is not that urgent and important. Besides, the government is not doing nothing. If ordinary people cannot afford, then why not some people together buy it and share the ownership. If that still cannot work, then why not rent a house which may be poor in quality at a low price. Anyway, there must be some ways for the ordinary people and poor people to get a house. So the conflicts between elites and the poor are not that severe.<br>Overall, I think the potential to go up overwhelms that to go down. And maybe no sooner than the spring in 2021 and no later than autumn in 2022, the price will go up.</p><p>Update 2020.12.21：<br>Critical question 1: Whether regulations nowadays can actually control the rising of price?<br>Critical question 2: If the price rises, who benefit more, the leaders or their opponents?</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

That might be due to varied accessibility of different food or nutrients to sustain for a long trip. To find out what food they specifically eat during migration, biologists divise a way to study the change. They test Carbon signature in birds’ breaths and different tissues. Cardon signature, in others words, the ratio of Carbon 14 to Carbon 12, will change due to different food they eat. And Carbon signature in breaths can tell their recent diet, while that in blood cells or feathers can tell their previous diets. And hence, biologists can know what they eat along the way.<br>Such method have huge applications. After knowing changes in diets, experts can guess why birds choose different diets and set bird feeders on stopsites along the way with perfect ratios of food for them. In this way, migratory birds can be better preserved.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

And geoscience experts are curious about why that could happen. One plausible hypothesis is that access to more nutrients lead to the proliferation. So here comes to what caused huge tons of nutrients. The hypothesis believes that some present-day continents collided with each other at Cambrian time and form a huge mountain range. And also the mountain range was near the equator, so frequent rains helped to weather those rocks and sands and brought mineral materials to the ocean. Those mineral nutrients went through the food chains and push organisms to evolve into new species. For example, more calcium means the possibility of shell animals. So the comparatively quick and huge convergence of nutrients brought about the life explosion.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now Biden and Harris have won the presidential election in 2020. I am curious about whether democrats can still win the next presidential election in 2024. Biden now is 77, so in 2024, he will be 81. And the oldest present once in term of office was 77 years old Reagan. So I think it is nearly impossible for Biden to compete for the next election. Harris may replace him to run as democrat candidates. But her opinions are regarded as the most liberal among all senators by GovTrack,an independent nonpartisan website, but labeled as a pragmatic moderates by New York Times, compared to a radical by Fox News. I also check for some detailed descriptions about her on Politico, and overall I think she is a little bit left among democrat candidates, especially on questions about paid leave of workers as well as immigrants without US papers. Biden win the election, in my opinion, because of his kind of moderate standpoints. However, Harris, at least now, cannot appeal to median voters as Biden. Besides, after 4 years, people will gradually forget some problems brought up during Trump era. To make questions simpler, We temporarily put aside whether Trump will run for the next election. Though he declares that a lot, his words don’t always correspond to his behavior and whether other republicans still support him for the next election is still in question. Let’s just suppose half to half. Whether Harris will beat republican opponents 4 years later is really hard to say. But the following one year or two can tell us something.<br>How Harris would implement policies, amend laws and help American system operate is worth attention. And of course how people react to her, especially the wobblers and median voters.<br>The second is how Biden’s team heal and bridge people in different groups. The great divide has already begun during Obama era. It has been nearly 6-8 years and of course Biden’s first term of office cannot handle it all. A little bit left-wing candiates is hard to win if the divide keeps the same as in 2020. I guess tech companies will take measures to cope with the divide which to a certain degree is enlarged by tech company’s algorithms. But republicans now is really in sort of dilemma, because the variety of their base is gradually disappearing and they need to make full use of the divede to win the election. ANd therefore, the second battle field is the divide.<br>Let’s just wait and see.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Today’s-Topic-Is-About-Duration-of-a-Pandemic"><a href="#Today’s-Topic-Is-About-Duration-of-a-Pandemic" class="headerlink" title="Today’s Topic Is About Duration of a Pandemic"></a>Today’s Topic Is About Duration of a Pandemic</h2><p>When a contagious disease will affect most of people in most areas, WHO will announce it as a pandemic. Whether it is still going or stopped depends on the speed on which it spreads and affects people. If it cannot spread anymore, we can say it has been controled. And overall, there are three ways to control. The first is to do nothing and let people exposed to the bacteria or virus as much as possible. Though the health system still tries its best to save patients, doctors will know little about the microbes in limited time. So this would cause maybe millions of people to die and the rest who survive can have the antibody. When the percentage of people who are immune to the pandemic reaches a certain point, microbes will find it hard to get a host, and therefore the pandemic is stopped.<br>The second, is to slow the spread and save more time for specialists to devise vaccines. To slow down the spread, some measures need to be taken, like quarantine and keeping social distance. Also, in the first period, medical personnel need to find ways to test whether a person is a carrier. Where the pandemic first break out may need help from other regions in health care, and because other regions do not face great pressure as the break-out region, other regions can dispatch some of their medical personnel to lend a hand. Of course, the degree of keeping social distance corresponds to how severe the pandemic is in this specific region. If everything works out just fine, people can also get to work and have normal life as before. After several months, when vaccines are brought out, governments can help people to get vaccines by grants. And like the circumstance before, microbes cannot find hosts when enough people are immune.<br>The third is to let all governments cooperate instantly and tightly. The main idea is to control the pandemic just in one or several locations after the breakout by cutting off transportation and strong quarantines. So this could stop the pandemic even in several weeks.<br>Just like every coin has two sides. The approaches mentioned above have pros and cons. The first is quicker than the second one to stop the pandemic but cannot handle microbes which vary quickly and frequently. The second is the longest to control a pandemic. But all the spent time is worth because vaccines can help people get perpetual immunity to a certain type of microbes and experts can devise different types of vaccines to cope with varied microbes. The thrid is quickest to control, but in reality, it is difficult to get all governments handle together. Besides, there are always unexpected ways to spread the pandemic, for example, the virus may vary and become capable of affecting both mice and people. The mice then move across borders, causing the disease to speard again.<br>During the coronaviurs-19, most countries take the second measure. And now it is lucky that some health-care companies have devised vaccines which can effctively protect over 90% testers. From all experience in this pandemic, we could do better in next pandemics to come. Maybe we will succeed in making our offsprings not even know the names of every pandemics they facing in the future.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

And with the development of Human Genemo Project, technology on determining individuals’ genes were more and more popular among enterprises. Some commercial gene analyses could use information in gene to tell you about your ancestors, in other words, where your ethnicity belongs to. From a biological point of view, after hundreds of generations, ancestors’ genes are barely traceable in offsprings’ genes. So how can commercial gene analyses tell you about your ancestors? It would compare your genes with averaged gene constituents in each region. The degree of similarity is gained and it will conclude the percentage as the possibility of you having an ancestor in that region. But one inaccuracy is that this method uses nowadays people’s gene as ancestors’ genes in the same region. Another inaccuracy is caused by the incomplete of data base. Now regions in Africa and some islands in Pacific Ocean is not included in the database. So one individual’s similarities in genes in these regions cannot be detected. </p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

Atmosphere on Earth has gone through a process similar to species’ evolution, from an oxygen-lacking atmosphere to an oxygen-abounding atmosphere. And one similar thing betweeen Earth and Titan is that they both have thick atmosphere, and thick atmosphere is one key element in life’s origin. From the background knowlege of physics I learned, to be specific, the Maxwell distribution law of molecular speeds, the greater an celestial object is, the harder for gas molecules to escape from the atmosphere. Titan is the largest moon of Saturn, so it is still possible for it to have thick atmosphere. It is hard to believe that Earth and Titan will share similarities becuase their distance to sun differs so much that light reaching Titan is only one percent of that reaching Earth. Therefore, there are liquid cycles on both objects, though, one is liquid water and the other is liquid methane.<br>Another similarity is that they both have volcanos which emit water, methane and ammonia. In the early stage of Earth’s atmosphere, it abounded with carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia. And it might be fimiliar to many people that key compounds in organic bodies involve amino acid, which needs the element N. So one magic is that once upon a time, Earth could provide large amount of ammonia which could form life later. Scientists nowdays are interested in researching the evolution of Titan’s atmosphere, which may shed some light on how life on earch came into reality.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Today’s-Topic-Is-About-the-Symbolism-of-Flags"><a href="#Today’s-Topic-Is-About-the-Symbolism-of-Flags" class="headerlink" title="Today’s Topic Is About the Symbolism of Flags"></a>Today’s Topic Is About the Symbolism of Flags</h2><p>Human beings, by instinct, like the sense of belongings. And in history, flags were often used as a way to unify some people who had the same interets as insiders. At the same time, people who didn’t belong to the group would be regarded as outsiders. There were always the effects of division as byproducts. And in many cases, outsiders were not simply regarded as outsiders but rather enemies and this led to some huge conflicts and war, for example, the Nazi German flags during the world war II. Besides, different flags have different degree of restrictions on members within the group. Take national flags as example. In China, if one expresses disrespect on the national flags, like scribbling on flags or burn flags in public, he/she would commit a crime regarding to the national flag laws. And in India, if a flag is not manufactured officially, the producer would face a violation on laws. Let’s have a look at the other end of the spectrum. United States, though, have laws on national flags, such laws are not feasible. The laws respect to one’s freedom on minds and cannot force someone to be patriotic. Hence the law which forbiddens use of national flags as costumes and phenomena of players in Major League Baseball having figures of  national flags on their back.<br>How to use flags propriately to represent a group of people and avoid regarding outsiders as enemies is an open questions. And it is not limited to flags. Anything which can represent one’s belongings also counts. Take me as an example, every day, I can see national flags, my university’s emblem, student association’s emblems and so on. In most times, members in a group, or some leaders, per se, won’t arouse their hatred towards the outsiders. But in some extreme conditions, some leaders may utilize flags not just as flags but as weapons to declare and try to win a war. Under such circumstances, members need to be concious about whether the war is what most members really want and a step back with thorough thinking can slow down the process of using flags as weapons. Also like the handling after the world war II, such behaviors should be punished and those flags need to be banned. Besides, teach later generations about the whole histroy in case that such tragedy won’t happen again, at least within several generations.<br>At last, I also agree to the idea that humans now need to look out of the concept of nations. We need to unify and cooperate as human beings. We are the same species and we share the earth. Bon’t be misled by some propagandas which declare that nation’s interests are always in correspondance with citizens’. Just like members in any group, one need be clear about the facts that sometimes nations’ behalfs are only the leaders behalfs, maybe they want to do something great to satisfy their sense of achievements, maybe they want their names to last forever. We also need to be clear that sometimes what leaders say won’t be what they will actually do.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

The first is local protectism. Because of the great firewall in China, some glocal applications like facebook, google and twitter cannot enter into the market in China, but on the other side, some Chinese apps like tiktok enter into the United States market and obtain lots of users and make a fortune. The second is the safety and privacy of users’ data. Whether Chinese companies obey the same rule about data safety with United States is still in concern, and without doubt, a company having more data about users can better predict their bahavior. Besides that, by showing different content to different users, like showing some racism things to racists, the company can influence users’ thinking and control some critical events like elections to a certain degree, for example, facebook’s scandals on interfering  elections on 2016. The third is the freedom of speech. Obvious people in China and United States have different degree of freedom to say, and companies in these two countries put different amount of efforts to sensor sensitive or illegal information. Discrepancies on values definitely bring about conflicts on people’s rights to say freely. The fourth is government’s involvement. China’s companies all need to follow the basic rules set by governments, including both the explicit and implicit rules. Undoubtedly, a Chinese company need to promise its functions for the nation prior to its own benefits. Although some are the same for United States companies, but the degree is different. Another involment of government is government’s grants for Chinese companies. So actually chinese companies are easier to lower their products’ price and win the competition. And sometimes their goals may not be maximizing their profits but other political or diplomatic goals. But whether grants are justified is hard to say, and in my opinion, if we look back the history, it is really hard for the following companies to beat up big companies which already control the market and win a reputation. </p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

At first glance, voting seems to be that every eligible person make his/her votes on each choice and specific organizations count the votes and declare the choice with most votes would be the winner. But this clearly ignore minority’s opinions and sometimes one choice’s advantage is not overwhelming compared to other choices. So large quantites of people’s benefits and opinions are ignored. The method above is known as plurality voting.<br>To solve the problem, some people suggest instant runoff method. Each person ranks each choice and then people compare the number of all people’s no.1 ranking. If one choice appears the least times among all the choices, then its votes will be transfered to the next choice on ranking lists of people who ranks this choice as no.1. And after the elimination of this choice, the remaining choices will go through the same process until there is one choice left. But the problem is that some people may cheat in the voting. If they know they are minority and their first choice will be eliminated and majority’s first choice is the worst for them among all choices, they will put a not that bad choice as their first choice rather than their most satisfying choice. Hence, such a not that bad choice may eventually beat majority’s first choice.<br>The third method is mutiple runoff. Firstly people arrange a runoff between the latter half of each person’s preference list about all choices. And transfer the loser choice’s votes to the winner’s and eliminate the loser choice. Repeat the process until there is one choice left. But this method is also criticized for people’s potential cheating as above.<br>The last choice I will describe is condorcet voting. Every two possible choices will face a runoff. And all people votes for these two choices and know people’s preference on the whole. After all comparison between two choices, people can know which choice wins the most times and regard this choice as the best choice for all people. That said, if there are 3 choices and A is prefered to B, B is prefered to C, C is prefered to A, then people cannot tell which choice is the best.<br>In fact, mathematicians have already proved that there isn’t any voting system satisfying a list of principles which reflect people’s expectation on a fair voting. And in different system, different people will benefit from such systems. Democracy and fairness are complex and from what we have learned right now, we can still devise a comparably fair system according to who are voting and what people are voting for.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the associate press just announced Biden’s winning on elecion in 2020, the elecion thing is kind of settled down. Personally speaking, I still think Trump is still going to fight till the end because he will be face with lots of lawsuits after his losing power in the White House. But still Biden is most likely to get the power of presidency. In the whole process, I always paid attention to the circumstances in each state and the variation in odds in some big online betting websites which serve as additional information to help me understand the trend. Before the beginning of counting votes, I predicted that Biden would win Trump but wouldn’t exceed Trump too much, and Trump may not give up and use his advantages in the Supreme Court to grapple with Biden. But now, Biden’s advantages on votes over Trump is bigger than my previous thoughts. It seems less likely for Trump to take back his position in the White House, unless he is so determined to stir up a big mess and chaos in America. But even if he makes his final decision to put his all into the fight regardless of the aftermaths, some poerful men, like some leaders in Republican party, previously in his group may quit and try to prevent his crazy ideas in reture.<br>So the next quesion, what will happen if Biden becomes the president? What is going to change compared to Trump time? I guess he will rebuild relationships with Europe and south-east Asia. At least he will build stable relationships with traditional leagues. He is more mature than Trump and knows the secret to politics is to keep a balance and not be extreme in either way. And he will lessen some former extreme policies like building the wall between United States and Mexico. And I am happy with his winning on election. Although I am not fancy about that acedemic communication between China and United States can return to the level after 1978 (when China and United States recovered their diplomatic relationship) or the level in the second World War, but I still think academic communication through normal approaches can be easier than that in Trump’s period, say exchange programs, or unofficial foreign students’ pursuing on acedemic performances. And rebuild people’s belief in science and technology. He may also pay more attention on some global issues, like the global warming and its outcomes. And green energy will face faster and stronger development.<br>Some people said before that the new cold war is coming. I agree with this to a certain degree. I believe China will make greater progress in economy and military affairs than former competitors of United States, like Germany and Japan. And such progress will definitely cause United States’ attention and competition. But the cold war in 1950s was just after the world war II and international communication and cooperation back then was less extensive than those nowadays. With much more efforts it takes to wholly isolate two groups of leagues, the new cold war will be less colder than the former one.<br>But on the whole, I still hope the world will progress and different countries will be in cooperation more instead of conflicts.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

      <title>Economics-Ideas of Marginal</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first posts about economics. I think one of the most significant ideas in economics is the idea of “marginal”. Maginal corresponds to the idea of “derivatives and differential” in mathematics. In real life, people won’t think on the whole but rather, they think about what would happen if they make a single choice or make a small difference. If a producer finds out produce one more products, he can still make profits. Then he will produce one more, if other factors like whether he is too tired to work, are ignored. Through this methods of “marginal”, and some quantification methods (quantifying and using parameters help us to dessribe details involved in making decisions more clearly), we can predict a person’s behavior to a certain degree. In conclusion, the effectiveness of your prediction depends on the completeness of your medels and the validity of your parameters. And one disapointing thing which should not be neglected is that there is no totally precise and robust models and systems.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Today’s-Topic-Is-About-Shared-Data-to-Tech-Companies"><a href="#Today’s-Topic-Is-About-Shared-Data-to-Tech-Companies" class="headerlink" title="Today’s Topic Is About Shared Data to Tech Companies"></a>Today’s Topic Is About Shared Data to Tech Companies</h2><p>Nowadays when we use an app or browing a website, there are always requests that for better experience, we should agree on the term conditions through which tech companies can collect our data. So here comes a question, whether we should be concerned about this? Big data or artificial intelligence can help us make decisions or know some details about ourselves, like,after we listen to lots of songs, some music application can help us understand our hidden music preferences and recommend more similar songs. However, only based on legal and moral use of technology, can technology play a more positive role in our lives. Algorithms might form biases about us and others like insurance companies, employees and police may adopt those biases. Algorithms may make mistakes and make wrong judgements about us because technology nowadays is not robust enough. The truth is that we now cannot avoid using digital equipment and those app and websites developer will definitely acquire our information. This is unavoidable with the development of IT. Government and the public should be aware that it’s our right to make sure our right is used properly, legally and morally. So those tech company should be monitored by the government or some critical data should be preserved only by the government. And from the view of history, tech companies collect information and through more information, they can provide more suitable survice for each individual and make more profits. So it is unrealistic to totally ban trades about information. The solution is to inform all users that the company’s technology, to be specific, those algorithms, are not totally robust, not totally precise about prediction, recommendation and profiling for each user. Company should tell their clients themselves, for example, by showing this piece of information at the start of apps or websites. They even need to provide their testing results of their algorithms (the same as medical companies should provide results of tests on effectiveness of medicine), like how precise their algorithm is to predict clients’ behavior and predisposition. If the data is so critical for each individual, companies would be forced by laws to open their codes to the public. Besides, the government also should spread the idea to the public that algorithms, at least nowadays, are not omnipotent. And government should try their best to make changes and requirements mentioned above happen. </p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

      <title>Reflection on the 3rd WORLD LAUREATES FORUM--Mind of Science</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some sub-venues of the third WORLD LAUREATE FORUM was located in Shanghai, and my school provided access to some parts of this meeting. What impressed me the most is the laureate of Nobel Prize, Steven Chu ‘s talk on life choices, career choices and so on. His talk might have something to do with the location of this year’s sub-venue of physics, Shanghai. Most anticipants are Chinese and one critical thing, which I think is the key difference in Chinese school’s and America’s school’s atmosphere, most Chinese students focus more on career. So his talk on career choice was really relevant to the situation here compared to another laureate’s talk. Actually, although Steven Chu is a Chinese American, he could still get to know Chinese students’ thoughts about research or career because he got in touch with many Chinese students studying in America. Quote, youth is wasted on the young, end quote. When you are young, whether you would like to take risks. He did some what seemed dangerous to the young, like hundling chemicals. And he still chose to become a physicist in spite of the recession at that time. Doing research can make you live a comfortalble life if you are satisfied about wearing simple clothes and living a simple life. But doing research and making a lot of money is mutually exclusive. He have used his car for 19 yeras and he still hopes that be his last car. Even back in Stanford, the cradle for entrepreneurs, as a professor, he was encouraged by many people to get a startup, but he refused because he didn’t want to spare time on such things. To be happy, he thinks that  firstly one needs to be able to share happiness and secondly, to have global empathy. In my opinion, different jobs are not equivalent regarding to their meaning to the world. On average, scientists acctually do the most sacrifice and contribute the most to the world, and this is why I always pay much respect to scientists. Not all the people are the same and not all people are suitable for doing research. But everyone can think of a way to contribute to others rather than just their own little circle. Don’t be drown in your Wechat or Facebook or anything, jump out, find what you like, stick on to it and make contribution not only to you, but to the outside of your circle.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

But I’m still fascinated by this speaker’s passion and innovation on drawing. She thought she was an outsider while she was in London, Tokyo or New York. She was in a foster family in London and all other kids and her parents are white people. She was not satisfied about her development in London and later on began her exploration in Tokyo and New York. And back there, she found her own styles about using fluent and sleek lines to show her and her inner world. And her experience proves that through drawing or some form of arts like that, one can really show one’s inner world and contact the outside world. It does not involve very complicated drawing technics. Just draw what you like, what you are thinking in your mind and just do it. And it’s especially useful when you feel alone and want to find a way to show your ideas or to lower your pressure. Art is a form of communication and I think that’s the most important thing about art.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

There are already tons of theories and therapies to help cure people out of the aftermath of those sufferings. But those guidelines are truly hard to follow strictly even for those experts who tell you to do these. So in most cases, we’ll find people use negative and short-period methods to get rid of sorrows, like drowning in alcohol.  Compared  to pretending nothing has happened, a better way is to live forward with sorrows, which can be eased by some helpful ways.<br>From now on, you don’t need to get stuck with complicated theories or some even worse outcomes warned to you by experts if you don’t follow their instructions. Just three key ways can help you get back to the driver’s seat and roll back onto your life.<br>First, it is essential to admit those bad things’ happening. Actually unfortune falls to everyone, and it’s true that the degree of unfortunes differs on different people. But admitting your miserable experience is still helpful in avoiding endless groaning about your sorrow and avoiding repeatedly asking why it falls on you rather than someone else. Admitting is the first step to live together with sorrow.<br>The second is to control your instinct. People are inclined to focus on bad results rather than happy results. This helps our ancestors to be cautious about dangers and successfully avoid them. But nowadays most bad results are not critical on our survival or not, so it’s time to control such instincts and the attention and energy spent on them. And there’s a good way to divert your attention to other things–think of three happy things each day. Sticking onto this habit can really make people grateful and positive towards life.<br>The last is to check whether each thing you are about to do is useful. Whether meeting the criminals is useful. Whether drinking one more bottle of wine is helpful. Whether staying up late all nights is helpful. Checking the whether your behavior is useful and justified can bring about great influence to all the corners of your life. Just like one of my teachers said before, the limits of speed of cars is not functioning of engines but performances of brakes. Thinking about the aim of each behavior and whether the behavior can really lead you to that aim can serve as brakes to avoid taking actions immediately and recklessly.This method is helpful not just in dealing with recovery of sorrows and unfortunes, but also in every decisions and every actions you are to make. If I had learner about it before, I wouldn’t do something meaningless, like staying up late playing gmaes, just to drain off my bad emotions. Actually such behaviors cannot bring me much peach and there are obviously better alternatives.<br>Just 3 methods can lead to a wholly different life. This can be applied to every emotional fluctuation brought by some unanticipated outcomes. Admittedly it is hard to follow them strictly every day, but even you can sometimes think of them, they still help a lot.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

And because the death ratio is not that severe as SARS-CoV and won’t be affected by high temperature in summer, covid-19 can more easily speard over the world infecting more people and causing more damage. Now people around the world are waiting for the appearance of effective vaccines to control this disaster. However, to divise an effective vaccine is not that simple. It should follow a strict processing rules, firstly laboratory research, secondly clinical tests and lastly manufacture. Genarally it takes around 20 years to finish all these steps and get well-performed vaccines, meaning that they are resilient, long-lasting and don’t have many side effects. But under special circumstances, such as this well-spread infection, time on each stage can be greatly shortened by several parallel researches and tests going on simultaneously. This parallel process is most distinct during the first stage because there are many ways to devise a vaccine involving using weakened virus or taking out specific part of virus to serve as anti-body. So it is obious that this first research stage is the most creative part because there are many ways to weaken a virus biologically or chemically and to choose a anti-body part. There are several laboratory vaccines testable nowadays. But what’s disappointing is that only being testable is only the beginning of the whole process. The most time-consuming part is clinical testing. That needs to strictly follow certain orders. It’s also divided into three parts, phase one focusing on intensity of triggered immune ability, phase two focusing on the right dosage and delivery method of vaccines on wider population and phase three focusing on determining safety and potential side effects on people who are about to use. Lastly, manufacturers use different pipe lines to produce different vaccines because every vaccine uses different composition.<br>From all above, it is laborous and time-consuming to produce vaccines but collaboration can speed up this process.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

Although this is not my major, I am still fond of knowing more about it to help me live a better life. Steroids is most infamous because its usage on sports events, and atheletes, as well as rule makers responsible for fairness of sports, seem to get stuck into the “Game Theory”. Atheletes will use more complicated chemicals, which cannot be tested by current equipments, but it in reture stimulates the advance of testing equipments and techinics. But usage of steroids is not limited to this. Actually, it plays an important role in our bodies, which is evident regarding its own existance in our body. Steroids have one big advantage compared to other kinds of chemicals when serving as information to regulate gene expression in our cells. That is steroids can pass through membrane of cells, combine with some other chemicals in the cell and direct gene expression, instead of combining with some proteins on membranes and producing corresponged chemicals in the cell itself to influence gene expression. Going directly into the cell means faster influence. So some asteroids can help to ease acute disease. And because it can influence gene expression, which plays a role in immune system, asteroids can help to handle self-immune diseases, like rash, which means that your immune system begins to attack your normal cells. Asteroids can lower the immune system’s ablitiy and thus decrease the attack on your own cells. But such methods cannot help people get rid of what cause the overeacted immune alarm. If the alarm happens over and over again, then patients need to take long-term asteroids. But in reture, it will cause some side-effects.<br>In conclusion, asteroids play an essential role in our body by regulating our gene expression. Its usage is not limited to just stimulants, it is also active in controling your immune system as medicine.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

They are easily to become negetive, but the speaker thought there is one thing worth noting: nagetivity will have deeper influence and play a more important role in overcoming the sad situation. However, I don’t think nagetivity will always play a bigger role, and I think it’s hard to compare each’s impacts on changing the situation. Positivity can make you believe in yourself and stick on to your plan, which might be vital to your final victory, but it can also lead you into over-confidance and create the discrepancies between what you do and what you imagine. Negativety is better at letting you do most needed things to improve the situation, while it will also destroy your resolution if it is out of control.<br>At last, the speaker suggested you always switch to neutral and that’s also the common ground of the speaker and me. Just like driving a car, you always switch to neutral before slowing down or speeding up. Not too ambitious and positive nor too sentimental and negative, that’s the difficulty of balancing.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

By this way, experimental and clinical tests can distinguish effective and safe drugs from bad drugs, which may even bring severe side effects to patients. And FDA, as well as “generic drugs”, is aimed at setting such basic rules for drugs. It is clear that drugs safety depends on the effectiveness of these rules and process of executing. However, the system for testing drugs and whether the drugs meet the requirements of FDA, are based on manufacturer’s own conscience. To be specific, the administrater won’t see the results of experiments or tests themselves but rather see reports on those experiments. The lack of overseeing the experiments and checking the validity of data is making room for fake data. If the drugs can pass the test, then everything is okay. But if the drugs fail the test, manufacturer may fake their data instead of purifying their drugs to pass the test, and make their fortune by selling potentially uneffective to the world.<br>This news also reminds me of a movie about an Indian drugs manufacturer forged HIV drugs and sold these drugs to Indians or Chinese. However, in that movie, the forged drugs were as effective as real ones. Because the real drugs were protected by intelligence laws and were sold in high prices, most people could only buy forged drugs in black markets. At last, the manufacturer was arrested for violating the intelligence law, but the government decided to lend a helping hand to people by offering subsidies.<br>To ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs, there are mainly two approaches. The first one is to make sure admistraters on drugs can actually see the process of making drugs and results of tests on drugs. The second one is to let patients know more information about drugs they use. Some basic facts like how the drugs are produced, where they are produced and results of tests should be shown to buyers and patients.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

And with development of parades for Goerge Floyd, racial problem comes on the table again. Personally speaking, I don’t think impressions based on one’s skin color, one’s family, one’s status, one’s appearance  are not justified at all. Those things can serve as indicators of people to a certain degree. Of course, indicators mentioned above, to be more specific, all kinds of indicators, are not 100% precise. But from the view of possibility, behaving differently to different people based on their “indicators” is reasonable and rational, which can bring about greatest amount of averaged benefits(just like gaining greatest expectations in statistic problems in math). But in most cases, people won’t contact others only once, and they may encounter others repeatedly. Hence, the most idealized circumstance is that a person need to adjust his/her manners to others based on their following interactions afterwards. So when they first meet, one might hurt others’ feelings only based on, like, others’ race and skin color. But afterwards, with more communication, one probably realize that others are not the kind of people he/she thinks before.  This is the first adjustment one should be aware of.<br>The second rectification is that one’s perception of others’ “indicators” should be “updated” to the “latest version”. It is common nowadays that some people still use outdated “version” of “indicators”, say, last 20 years’ version or even last century’s. This may be due to some people’s lack of updated information or not choosing to walk out of their thinking pattern and circle. If a person only get access to one kind of information, the information will reinforce itself and it’s hard for him/her to get out. To get rid of it, one need to know about more information from more sources and try to think a bit differently.<br>To be honest, these two adjustments are not easy for everyone. This is a complicated world. There are complicated circumstances. But to make it forward, I still think to help people get better education(not just learn to work out some math problems or to recite some articles or to know some basic knowledge in each subject) and to advocate more people to achieve these two adjustments mentioned above are essential.  </p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

There are still huge conflicts about whether impacts of colonies are overall advantageous or disadvantageous. The professor, as well as I, thinks that we cannot embellish colonies as something benevolent or nice. The major parts of colonies are still dark and ruthless. In my opinion, cologial behavior is driven by profits and therefore, what colonizers did was not for residents in colonies but for their own benefits. When benefits of colonizers and residents came into conflicts, in most times, residents had nothing to do but surrender. It is undeniable that some settlers in colonies did something nice and kind, like helping sick local people etc, but colonization is evil and bloody in general.<br>All things happen for “history”. Colonization still has huge impacts on south-east Asia nowadays, like how local people represent themselves, what they think about their past and history, and how they interact with people from countries which colonized them in the past.<br>Jump out of box and have independent thinking. This is important for not only professors, but also each individual in society. Independent thinking helps to distinguish reasonable views between just rumors and to form one’s own history views and world views. Of course, to achieve this needs some reading and thinking. It doesn’t require people to become experts in related fields. Just be cautious about everyone’s ideas, even he/she is the most informative guy and compare different ideas about same issues. MOre acceptance on new ideas (not necessarily the correct ideas) and critical thinking help the society to get rid of stereotypes and move forward in history.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

Based on understanding of interviewees, can journalists find “the third”–new things or ideas generated when two people get in touch.<br>By the way, I really like his vivid video style.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

Typically, with similar interests, people can get together; with conflicting values, people will split apart. Most people always stay in their circle, holding their original beliefs and reinforcing their world views. But to achieve better relationships with more people, to get out of your comfort zone, you have to learn to negotiate and find common grounds with others. This is not easy for most times. It's easier to get rage and disagree with others than to calm down and have a thorough thinking about why others would think like that, why I would think like this and whether there are possibilities to live together without forced changes on either's beliefs. To find common grounds, the first is to show extravagent grace to others. "Extravagent" means that even if sometimes others' behavior offends us, we still need to keep calm and try to communicate. In this more and more divided world, people are easy to get into what is called AGONISM. If people love someone, they agree to all he/she does or believes. If people disagree with someone, they hate or fear him/her. Only based on common grounds, can people calmly discuss with others and try to understand. And only with grace rather than explosion with anger, can people try to find common grounds. Lastly, we still need to be cautious about the degree of tolerance and grace. Single or several unconcious offenses can be tolerated, but intentional, frequent and illegal offenses need to be handled through laws.<table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

The speeker, with genetic mutations on immune system, has lived with cancers, to be specific, not just a single cancer, since her childhood. The greatest uncertainty, I mean, to all people, is when your life will come to cease. You don’t know whether what you do everyday will make a difference in the future because you may just have to stop sometimes. You can stay where you are and do nothing; or do what you want to do the most right here and right now. You are left with only these two choices. Think more about it, and you’ll find, the best choice is to stop the uncertainty interfering your own life and just be yourself, do what you want, become whom you want to be and strive for it. Whether you come to your goal fast or not does not matter, and what matters is that you want your each day meaningful and progress towards your goal.<br>Besides, there are also great distinctions between American and Chinese doctors’ methods, attitudes towards patients, especially patients with cancers. Less respect on patients’ desires and too much efforts on therapy itself sometimes make Chinese doctors utilitarian and cruel. There must be some reasons underlying the comparatively tense relationship between doctors and patients. To correct highly utilitarian atmosphere in medical fields, it is a long way to go.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>
