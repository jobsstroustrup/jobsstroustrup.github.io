To get what people concerns more accurately, he began to concentrate on people’s signs while in interview. It was throught the experience that he got to know the importance of journalists as bridges between interviewees and others including journalists themselves. Based on understanding of interviewees, can journalists find “the third”–new things or ideas generated when two people get in touch.<br>By the way, I really like his vivid video style.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

Typically, with similar interests, people can get together; with conflicting values, people will split apart. Most people always stay in their circle, holding their original beliefs and reinforcing their world views. But to achieve better relationships with more people, to get out of your comfort zone, you have to learn to negotiate and find common grounds with others. This is not easy for most times. It's easier to get rage and disagree with others than to calm down and have a thorough thinking about why others would think like that, why I would think like this and whether there are possibilities to live together without forced changes on either's beliefs. To find common grounds, the first is to show extravagent grace to others. "Extravagent" means that even if sometimes others' behavior offends us, we still need to keep calm and try to communicate. In this more and more divided world, people are easy to get into what is called AGONISM. If people love someone, they agree to all he/she does or believes. If people disagree with someone, they hate or fear him/her. Only based on common grounds, can people calmly discuss with others and try to understand. And only with grace rather than explosion with anger, can people try to find common grounds. Lastly, we still need to be cautious about the degree of tolerance and grace. Single or several unconcious offenses can be tolerated, but intentional, frequent and illegal offenses need to be handled through laws.<table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

The speeker, with genetic mutations on immune system, has lived with cancers, to be specific, not just a single cancer, since her childhood. The greatest uncertainty, I mean, to all people, is when your life will come to cease. You don’t know whether what you do everyday will make a difference in the future because you may just have to stop sometimes. You can stay where you are and do nothing; or do what you want to do the most right here and right now. You are left with only these two choices. Think more about it, and you’ll find, the best choice is to stop the uncertainty interfering your own life and just be yourself, do what you want, become whom you want to be and strive for it. Whether you come to your goal fast or not does not matter, and what matters is that you want your each day meaningful and progress towards your goal.<br>Besides, there are also great distinctions between American and Chinese doctors’ methods, attitudes towards patients, especially patients with cancers. Less respect on patients’ desires and too much efforts on therapy itself sometimes make Chinese doctors utilitarian and cruel. There must be some reasons underlying the comparatively tense relationship between doctors and patients. To correct highly utilitarian atmosphere in medical fields, it is a long way to go.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>
