        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some sub-venues of the third WORLD LAUREATE FORUM was located in Shanghai, and my school provided access to some parts of this meeting. What impressed me the most is the laureate of Nobel Prize, Steven Chu ‘s talk on life choices, career choices and so on. His talk might have something to do with the location of this year’s sub-venue of physics, Shanghai. Most anticipants are Chinese and one critical thing, which I think is the key difference in Chinese school’s and America’s school’s atmosphere, most Chinese students focus more on career. So his talk on career choice was really relevant to the situation here compared to another laureate’s talk. Actually, although Steven Chu is a Chinese American, he could still get to know Chinese students’ thoughts about research or career because he got in touch with many Chinese students studying in America. Quote, youth is wasted on the young, end quote. When you are young, whether you would like to take risks. He did some what seemed dangerous to the young, like hundling chemicals. And he still chose to become a physicist in spite of the recession at that time. Doing research can make you live a comfortalble life if you are satisfied about wearing simple clothes and living a simple life. But doing research and making a lot of money is mutually exclusive. He have used his car for 19 yeras and he still hopes that be his last car. Even back in Stanford, the cradle for entrepreneurs, as a professor, he was encouraged by many people to get a startup, but he refused because he didn’t want to spare time on such things. To be happy, he thinks that  firstly one needs to be able to share happiness and secondly, to have global empathy. In my opinion, different jobs are not equivalent regarding to their meaning to the world. On average, scientists acctually do the most sacrifice and contribute the most to the world, and this is why I always pay much respect to scientists. Not all the people are the same and not all people are suitable for doing research. But everyone can think of a way to contribute to others rather than just their own little circle. Don’t be drown in your Wechat or Facebook or anything, jump out, find what you like, stick on to it and make contribution not only to you, but to the outside of your circle.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

But I’m still fascinated by this speaker’s passion and innovation on drawing. She thought she was an outsider while she was in London, Tokyo or New York. She was in a foster family in London and all other kids and her parents are white people. She was not satisfied about her development in London and later on began her exploration in Tokyo and New York. And back there, she found her own styles about using fluent and sleek lines to show her and her inner world. And her experience proves that through drawing or some form of arts like that, one can really show one’s inner world and contact the outside world. It does not involve very complicated drawing technics. Just draw what you like, what you are thinking in your mind and just do it. And it’s especially useful when you feel alone and want to find a way to show your ideas or to lower your pressure. Art is a form of communication and I think that’s the most important thing about art.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Today’s-Topic-Is-About-Resilience"><a href="#Today’s-Topic-Is-About-Resilience" class="headerlink" title="Today’s Topic Is About Resilience"></a>Today’s Topic Is About Resilience</h2><p>Every now and then, people suffer. There are already tons of theories and therapies to help cure people out of the aftermath of those sufferings. But those guidelines are truly hard to follow strictly even for those experts who tell you to do these. So in most cases, we’ll find people use negative and short-period methods to get rid of sorrows, like drowning in alcohol.  Compared  to pretending nothing has happened, a better way is to live forward with sorrows, which can be eased by some helpful ways.<br>From now on, you don’t need to get stuck with complicated theories or some even worse outcomes warned to you by experts if you don’t follow their instructions. Just three key ways can help you get back to the driver’s seat and roll back onto your life.<br>First, it is essential to admit those bad things’ happening. Actually unfortune falls to everyone, and it’s true that the degree of unfortunes differs on different people. But admitting your miserable experience is still helpful in avoiding endless groaning about your sorrow and avoiding repeatedly asking why it falls on you rather than someone else. Admitting is the first step to live together with sorrow.<br>The second is to control your instinct. People are inclined to focus on bad results rather than happy results. This helps our ancestors to be cautious about dangers and successfully avoid them. But nowadays most bad results are not critical on our survival or not, so it’s time to control such instincts and the attention and energy spent on them. And there’s a good way to divert your attention to other things–think of three happy things each day. Sticking onto this habit can really make people grateful and positive towards life.<br>The last is to check whether each thing you are about to do is useful. Whether meeting the criminals is useful. Whether drinking one more bottle of wine is helpful. Whether staying up late all nights is helpful. Checking the whether your behavior is useful and justified can bring about great influence to all the corners of your life. Just like one of my teachers said before, the limits of speed of cars is not functioning of engines but performances of brakes. Thinking about the aim of each behavior and whether the behavior can really lead you to that aim can serve as brakes to avoid taking actions immediately and recklessly.This method is helpful not just in dealing with recovery of sorrows and unfortunes, but also in every decisions and every actions you are to make. If I had learner about it before, I wouldn’t do something meaningless, like staying up late playing gmaes, just to drain off my bad emotions. Actually such behaviors cannot bring me much peach and there are obviously better alternatives.<br>Just 3 methods can lead to a wholly different life. This can be applied to every emotional fluctuation brought by some unanticipated outcomes. Admittedly it is hard to follow them strictly every day, but even you can sometimes think of them, they still help a lot.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

And because the death ratio is not that severe as SARS-CoV and won’t be affected by high temperature in summer, covid-19 can more easily speard over the world infecting more people and causing more damage. Now people around the world are waiting for the appearance of effective vaccines to control this disaster. However, to divise an effective vaccine is not that simple. It should follow a strict processing rules, firstly laboratory research, secondly clinical tests and lastly manufacture. Genarally it takes around 20 years to finish all these steps and get well-performed vaccines, meaning that they are resilient, long-lasting and don’t have many side effects. But under special circumstances, such as this well-spread infection, time on each stage can be greatly shortened by several parallel researches and tests going on simultaneously. This parallel process is most distinct during the first stage because there are many ways to devise a vaccine involving using weakened virus or taking out specific part of virus to serve as anti-body. So it is obious that this first research stage is the most creative part because there are many ways to weaken a virus biologically or chemically and to choose a anti-body part. There are several laboratory vaccines testable nowadays. But what’s disappointing is that only being testable is only the beginning of the whole process. The most time-consuming part is clinical testing. That needs to strictly follow certain orders. It’s also divided into three parts, phase one focusing on intensity of triggered immune ability, phase two focusing on the right dosage and delivery method of vaccines on wider population and phase three focusing on determining safety and potential side effects on people who are about to use. Lastly, manufacturers use different pipe lines to produce different vaccines because every vaccine uses different composition.<br>From all above, it is laborous and time-consuming to produce vaccines but collaboration can speed up this process.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

Although this is not my major, I am still fond of knowing more about it to help me live a better life. Steroids is most infamous because its usage on sports events, and atheletes, as well as rule makers responsible for fairness of sports, seem to get stuck into the “Game Theory”. Atheletes will use more complicated chemicals, which cannot be tested by current equipments, but it in reture stimulates the advance of testing equipments and techinics. But usage of steroids is not limited to this. Actually, it plays an important role in our bodies, which is evident regarding its own existance in our body. Steroids have one big advantage compared to other kinds of chemicals when serving as information to regulate gene expression in our cells. That is steroids can pass through membrane of cells, combine with some other chemicals in the cell and direct gene expression, instead of combining with some proteins on membranes and producing corresponged chemicals in the cell itself to influence gene expression. Going directly into the cell means faster influence. So some asteroids can help to ease acute disease. And because it can influence gene expression, which plays a role in immune system, asteroids can help to handle self-immune diseases, like rash, which means that your immune system begins to attack your normal cells. Asteroids can lower the immune system’s ablitiy and thus decrease the attack on your own cells. But such methods cannot help people get rid of what cause the overeacted immune alarm. If the alarm happens over and over again, then patients need to take long-term asteroids. But in reture, it will cause some side-effects.<br>In conclusion, asteroids play an essential role in our body by regulating our gene expression. Its usage is not limited to just stimulants, it is also active in controling your immune system as medicine.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

They are easily to become negetive, but the speaker thought there is one thing worth noting: nagetivity will have deeper influence and play a more important role in overcoming the sad situation. However, I don’t think nagetivity will always play a bigger role, and I think it’s hard to compare each’s impacts on changing the situation. Positivity can make you believe in yourself and stick on to your plan, which might be vital to your final victory, but it can also lead you into over-confidance and create the discrepancies between what you do and what you imagine. Negativety is better at letting you do most needed things to improve the situation, while it will also destroy your resolution if it is out of control.<br>At last, the speaker suggested you always switch to neutral and that’s also the common ground of the speaker and me. Just like driving a car, you always switch to neutral before slowing down or speeding up. Not too ambitious and positive nor too sentimental and negative, that’s the difficulty of balancing.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

By this way, experimental and clinical tests can distinguish effective and safe drugs from bad drugs, which may even bring severe side effects to patients. And FDA, as well as “generic drugs”, is aimed at setting such basic rules for drugs. It is clear that drugs safety depends on the effectiveness of these rules and process of executing. However, the system for testing drugs and whether the drugs meet the requirements of FDA, are based on manufacturer’s own conscience. To be specific, the administrater won’t see the results of experiments or tests themselves but rather see reports on those experiments. The lack of overseeing the experiments and checking the validity of data is making room for fake data. If the drugs can pass the test, then everything is okay. But if the drugs fail the test, manufacturer may fake their data instead of purifying their drugs to pass the test, and make their fortune by selling potentially uneffective to the world.<br>This news also reminds me of a movie about an Indian drugs manufacturer forged HIV drugs and sold these drugs to Indians or Chinese. However, in that movie, the forged drugs were as effective as real ones. Because the real drugs were protected by intelligence laws and were sold in high prices, most people could only buy forged drugs in black markets. At last, the manufacturer was arrested for violating the intelligence law, but the government decided to lend a helping hand to people by offering subsidies.<br>To ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs, there are mainly two approaches. The first one is to make sure admistraters on drugs can actually see the process of making drugs and results of tests on drugs. The second one is to let patients know more information about drugs they use. Some basic facts like how the drugs are produced, where they are produced and results of tests should be shown to buyers and patients.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

And with development of parades for Goerge Floyd, racial problem comes on the table again. Personally speaking, I don’t think impressions based on one’s skin color, one’s family, one’s status, one’s appearance  are not justified at all. Those things can serve as indicators of people to a certain degree. Of course, indicators mentioned above, to be more specific, all kinds of indicators, are not 100% precise. But from the view of possibility, behaving differently to different people based on their “indicators” is reasonable and rational, which can bring about greatest amount of averaged benefits(just like gaining greatest expectations in statistic problems in math). But in most cases, people won’t contact others only once, and they may encounter others repeatedly. Hence, the most idealized circumstance is that a person need to adjust his/her manners to others based on their following interactions afterwards. So when they first meet, one might hurt others’ feelings only based on, like, others’ race and skin color. But afterwards, with more communication, one probably realize that others are not the kind of people he/she thinks before.  This is the first adjustment one should be aware of.<br>The second rectification is that one’s perception of others’ “indicators” should be “updated” to the “latest version”. It is common nowadays that some people still use outdated “version” of “indicators”, say, last 20 years’ version or even last century’s. This may be due to some people’s lack of updated information or not choosing to walk out of their thinking pattern and circle. If a person only get access to one kind of information, the information will reinforce itself and it’s hard for him/her to get out. To get rid of it, one need to know about more information from more sources and try to think a bit differently.<br>To be honest, these two adjustments are not easy for everyone. This is a complicated world. There are complicated circumstances. But to make it forward, I still think to help people get better education(not just learn to work out some math problems or to recite some articles or to know some basic knowledge in each subject) and to advocate more people to achieve these two adjustments mentioned above are essential.  </p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

There are still huge conflicts about whether impacts of colonies are overall advantageous or disadvantageous. The professor, as well as I, thinks that we cannot embellish colonies as something benevolent or nice. The major parts of colonies are still dark and ruthless. In my opinion, cologial behavior is driven by profits and therefore, what colonizers did was not for residents in colonies but for their own benefits. When benefits of colonizers and residents came into conflicts, in most times, residents had nothing to do but surrender. It is undeniable that some settlers in colonies did something nice and kind, like helping sick local people etc, but colonization is evil and bloody in general.<br>All things happen for “history”. Colonization still has huge impacts on south-east Asia nowadays, like how local people represent themselves, what they think about their past and history, and how they interact with people from countries which colonized them in the past.<br>Jump out of box and have independent thinking. This is important for not only professors, but also each individual in society. Independent thinking helps to distinguish reasonable views between just rumors and to form one’s own history views and world views. Of course, to achieve this needs some reading and thinking. It doesn’t require people to become experts in related fields. Just be cautious about everyone’s ideas, even he/she is the most informative guy and compare different ideas about same issues. MOre acceptance on new ideas (not necessarily the correct ideas) and critical thinking help the society to get rid of stereotypes and move forward in history.</p><table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

Typically, with similar interests, people can get together; with conflicting values, people will split apart. Most people always stay in their circle, holding their original beliefs and reinforcing their world views. But to achieve better relationships with more people, to get out of your comfort zone, you have to learn to negotiate and find common grounds with others. This is not easy for most times. It's easier to get rage and disagree with others than to calm down and have a thorough thinking about why others would think like that, why I would think like this and whether there are possibilities to live together without forced changes on either's beliefs. To find common grounds, the first is to show extravagent grace to others. "Extravagent" means that even if sometimes others' behavior offends us, we still need to keep calm and try to communicate. In this more and more divided world, people are easy to get into what is called AGONISM. If people love someone, they agree to all he/she does or believes. If people disagree with someone, they hate or fear him/her. Only based on common grounds, can people calmly discuss with others and try to understand. And only with grace rather than explosion with anger, can people try to find common grounds. Lastly, we still need to be cautious about the degree of tolerance and grace. Single or several unconcious offenses can be tolerated, but intentional, frequent and illegal offenses need to be handled through laws.<table>  <tbody><tr>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/alipay.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/wechat.bmp"></td>    <td><img width="100" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/shw2018/cdn@1.0/sakura/img/loader/orange.progress-bar-stripe-loader.svg" data-original="https://jobsstroustrup.github.io/medias/reward/zan.png"></td>     </tr></tbody></table><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

The speeker, with genetic mutations on immune system, has lived with cancers, to be specific, not just a single cancer, since her childhood. The greatest uncertainty, I mean, to all people, is when your life will come to cease. You don’t know whether what you do everyday will make a difference in the future because you may just have to stop sometimes. You can stay where you are and do nothing; or do what you want to do the most right here and right now. You are left with only these two choices. Think more about it, and you’ll find, the best choice is to stop the uncertainty interfering your own life and just be yourself, do what you want, become whom you want to be and strive for it. Whether you come to your goal fast or not does not matter, and what matters is that you want your each day meaningful and progress towards your goal.<br>Besides, there are also great distinctions between American and Chinese doctors’ methods, attitudes towards patients, especially patients with cancers. Less respect on patients’ desires and too much efforts on therapy itself sometimes make Chinese doctors utilitarian and cruel. There must be some reasons underlying the comparatively tense relationship between doctors and patients. To correct highly utilitarian atmosphere in medical fields, it is a long way to go.</p><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>
